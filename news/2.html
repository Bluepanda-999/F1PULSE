<p><strong>Valtteri Bottas</strong> is convinced that it’s important for his new team, <strong>Cadillac F1</strong>, to avoid excessive expectations during its debut season.</p>

<p>“I think <em>‘excitement’</em> is the right word to describe my mindset,” the Finnish driver shared in an interview with <em>RacingNews365</em>. “It’s encouraging that everything is still going according to plan, and the schedule is being followed. There haven’t been any major setbacks, although starting everything from scratch is not easy.</p>

<p><strong>It’s very important to avoid overly high expectations</strong>, especially in the first season — and particularly in its first quarter. We need to stay realistic, because achieving success will take time, but I’m ready for that. Personally, I intend to start the season without any special expectations. At first, they should be modest, since we still have to find out where we actually stand. But what matters more is <strong>the level we can reach — and how quickly we can get there.</strong>”</p>

<p>However, Bottas admits he’s slightly frustrated that he cannot fully focus on working with Cadillac yet, since he remains a reserve driver for <strong>Mercedes</strong> until the end of this season:</p>

<p>“If I could, I’d probably already be doing a greater amount of work for the team, because there’s so much to prepare. But I’m taking part in all the key meetings and can already provide the team with important information — we’ve already started discussions on several topics.”</p>
