<p>Senior management representatives of the new <strong>Cadillac F1</strong> team have repeatedly assured that the work on building their first Formula 1 car is progressing on schedule — and this has now been confirmed by <strong>Pat Symonds</strong>, who serves as the team’s <strong>Executive Engineering Consultant</strong> for the project.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“We are completely on schedule,” said <strong>72-year-old Symonds</strong> in an interview with <em>The Athletic</em>. “The date by which our first chassis must be ready for homologation was set many months ago — and the car will be completed by that day.</p>

    <p>The situation is somewhat intimidating, but everyone at Cadillac is showing incredible determination. Until <strong>March 7</strong> of this year, we didn’t even have official approval to enter the championship, and by then there were only <strong>364 days left before the first practice session in Australia.</strong> Building a full team in that time is almost impossible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Cadillac</strong>, however, began its preparations long before the FIA officially approved the 11th team’s entry. For example, <strong>wind tunnel testing of the prototype</strong> had already started in <strong>2024</strong>.</p>
