<p>Yesterday, on the final day of official <strong>Formula E testing</strong> in <strong>Valencia</strong>, only women took the wheel — every team in the world championship provided its electric car to one of the top female drivers. This year marked the <strong>second time</strong> such tests were held, and, as previously reported, their duration was <strong>doubled compared to last year.</strong></p>

<p>In both sessions, American driver <strong>Chloe Chambers</strong>, a member of the <strong>Red Bull Junior Team</strong>, dominated the field. Chambers currently races for <strong>Campos Racing</strong> in the <strong>F1 Academy</strong> and sits fourth in the standings with one round remaining.</p>

<h3>Results of the Women’s Test</h3>

<p>Several experienced Formula E race drivers supported and coached the female participants, offering advice and helping them avoid mistakes. Chambers mentioned this in her post-test comments:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>“We worked really well together with the team, both on the simulator and during the test in Valencia. It was fantastic to have <strong>Nyck de Vries</strong> helping me — thanks to his valuable advice, I was able to be among the fastest right away, which is obviously a great sign.</p>

    <p>We ran quite a few short stints to set competitive lap times and also practiced race starts — it was really exciting and fun. I was amazed by how the all-wheel-drive electric car responds to throttle input!”</p>
