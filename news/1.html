<p><strong>Leo Turini</strong>, a veteran of Italian motorsport journalism, could not stay away from the story of the court case <strong>“Felipe Massa vs. FIA, FOM, and Bernie Ecclestone”</strong>, since in the <strong>fall of 2008</strong> he was present both at the <strong>Singapore Grand Prix</strong> and at the <strong>Brazilian season finale</strong>…</p>

<p><strong>I’m writing about this because I owe it to Felipe Massa.</strong></p>

<p>Of course, what happened back then in <strong>Singapore</strong> is a matter of days long gone. Everyone who was in kindergarten in <strong>2008</strong> has already grown up, become young adults in their twenties, and has every right not to know what I’m about to talk about.</p>

<p>But for old eccentrics like me, it’s quite typical to mistakenly believe that the current generation should be aware of things about which they actually have no idea.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I’ll continue. In <strong>2008</strong>, I was at the <strong>Singapore Grand Prix</strong>. That same year, I was also in <strong>Interlagos</strong>. And now, allow me to ask: <strong>how much is it worth to lose a World Championship</strong> — especially when it’s done so impressively, almost theatrically?</p>

<p><strong>A little more than 80 million dollars</strong> — that’s the amount Massa intends to recover from those responsible for that incredible finale to the <strong>2008 championship</strong>, and the <strong>trial in the Royal Court of London is already underway</strong>…</p>
